# UFO
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to build a **Dynamic Webpage**. Dynamic Webpage is a page that accept user input and visually adjust to refelect the information. It is build by inserting JavaScript into a HTML Page. We will also use CSS in BootStrap and check our code.

A table is displayed containing UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list and a filter is added to the table so the user can filter the information from the table.
The table will be inserted in a visually displayed HTML page.

We will use basic HTML Page, CSS and bootStrap to build and style the entire page.
We has also include the Header, Article summary and brief notes.

The End result will be a presentation of data that is visually appealing and interactive.

### Resources
* Data Source: UFO data.js file
* Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript ES6+ , Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, BootStrap 4.0.0

* Under this, there is a filter with a few categories on the left side of the page and on the right side is the data set.

* You can use the filters on the left side by typing in the sought after correspondent variable in the filter and pressing enter. 

You can filter by one or all of the search criteria shown. For example, if you search by "date", you will see that the table updated to show the reported sightings that was recorded for that specific date.

* If you add a shape, the table will update filtering further to only display the information containing that shape.
* The filter will search for desired variable searched for and show each data set that fits the data.

## Summary
### Drawback
* One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. For example to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table a find the city desired for the analysis.
### Recommendations 
* A Drop down menu where you can pick multiple criteria would guide the user and makes the page more interactive.
* Also the ability to sort the table by more recent or least recent would improve user experience.
